The following CSS code has an uncommon bug related to the specificity of selectors:

```css
div.container p {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: red;
}

.container div p {
  color: green;
}
```

The expected behavior is that the paragraph within the div.container would be blue, but due to a nuanced specificity calculation, it may be green. The issue lies in how the browser calculates selector specificity.
